        <h4>Little info about me</h4>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Onyebuchi ifedi, a passionate web developer hailing from
          Enugun state, Nigeria. Born on 24th Mrach 1998, I'm on a mission to
          bring creativity to life through code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Joined Altschool Africa to help me in this journey, I'm fascinated by
          the power of HTML in structuring content and CSS in styling it. Every
          line of code feels like a step toward building something tangible on
          the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my learning journey, I'm discovering the magic of turning simple
          text into beautifully designed web pages. From creating my first
          "Hello World" webpage to experimenting with different CSS styles,
          every small achievement fuels my excitement to learn more.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm eager to connect with fellow learners, mentors, and anyone who
          shares a love for coding.
